''' For Windows
1.Download Python from the Microsoft store
2.Install it
3.You can move to cmd and check the Python installation by typing  python --version
4.if it doesn't work try py3 --version or py --version
5.If Python works you can use pip --version
6.If python3 works use pip3 --version
7.In the future use pip/pip3 install library name to install ex: pip install pygame or pip3 install pygame

For Mac users
Download from https://www.python.org/ recent version
It will download a zip file with Python packages
We need to extract it by double-clicking it 
Unzip and you will have an installation window opened
Install it, They might need an admin password to install Python sometimes, if the admin has blocked the installation of software to allow the install
You can move to terminal python --version
If it doesn't work try python3 --version
If Python works you can use pip --version
If python3 works use pip3 --version
In the future use pip/pip3 install library name to install ex: pip install pygame or pip3 install pygame
